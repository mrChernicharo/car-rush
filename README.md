###  Python | Pygame project

One of my first experiences developing games with pygame. 
Wrote it using Visual Studio Code IDE. 
Had lots of fun doing all the logics on animating sprites, setting boundaries and checking for collisions.
Feel free to clone the project and add as many new features as you like.
